## Titanic Dataset Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering. The goal is to understand the key factors influencing passenger survival and build predictive models to estimate survival on unseen data.

### Repository Contents

- **`train.csv`**: The training dataset provided by Kaggle, including features and the survival outcome.
- **`test.csv`**: The test dataset, used for evaluating model performance on unseen data.
- **`titanic_analysis.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the step-by-step analysis, data cleaning, and EDA.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

### Analysis Overview

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Handled missing values.
   - Converted categorical features into numerical representations.
   - Dropped unnecessary columns.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created new features such as family size and isolation status.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized survival rates by gender, passenger class, and family size.
   - Analyzed the correlation matrix to understand relationships between features.

4. **Model Building**:
   - Provided a framework for constructing predictive models based on the cleaned and engineered features.
